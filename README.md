# Embedded C

Activity handling many sources connected together. LED is to be blinked whenever the seat is occupied and heater is turned on. The ADC value is read and is taken as temperature sensor output. The ADC output is given to generate PWM output signal on oscillator. The temperature has to be sent as output through USART communication.
